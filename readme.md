## 🧠 Problem Statement

**Title:** AI-Induced Train Planning and Scheduling for Kochi Metro Rail Limited  
**Organization:** Government of Kerala – Kochi Metro Rail Limited  

Urban metro systems require accurate planning to handle:
- Variable demand
- Environmental factors
- Operational constraints  

The objective is to develop a digital solution that:
- Visualizes schedules clearly
- Integrates real-time data
- Is extendable to AI/ML-based automation for optimization
